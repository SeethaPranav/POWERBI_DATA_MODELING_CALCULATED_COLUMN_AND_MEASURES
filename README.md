# POWERBI_DATA_MODELING_CALCULATED_COLUMN_AND_MEASURES

Power BI repository showcasing data modeling techniques and the creation of calculated columns and measures using DAX for enhanced data analysis.

Data modeling in Power BI refers to the process of structuring and organizing data to facilitate analysis and reporting. It involves defining how different data tables relate to one another, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing the data for efficient querying. Here are some key aspects of data modeling:

1. **Data Sources**: Identifying and connecting to various data sources (e.g., databases, Excel files, cloud services).

2. **Tables and Relationships**: Creating tables to store data and establishing relationships between them, such as one-to-many or many-to-many, to reflect how data is connected.

3. **Normalization**: Structuring data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity, often by separating data into distinct tables.

4. **Hierarchies**: Setting up hierarchies to enable drill-down capabilities in reports.

5. **Calculated Columns and Measures**: Adding calculated columns for row-level calculations and measures for aggregating data in reports.

6. **Data Types and Formatting**: Defining appropriate data types for each column and applying formatting to ensure data is presented clearly.

Effective data modeling leads to better performance, easier analysis, and more insightful reports in Power BI.
